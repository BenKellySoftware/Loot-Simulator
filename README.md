# Loot-Simulator
A basic system for randomised loot drops and level generation.

# Future Plans
 - Create a graphical overlay for a map where you choose your levels from
 - Create Seperate store screen
 - You can buy buffs and health potions from the store
 - A tutorial system
 - Improved balancing that stretches out later levels, and increases difficulty to the point where buffs and health potions are required
 - Graphics in levels, player and enemy sprites, backgrounds.
 - Visible loot dropped from enemies the player must mouse over rather than them just being auto collected, ability for player to level up auto collection percentage or buy auto pickup buff.
 - Add 'Likelyhood of surviving' counter to missions, as well as more information on the missions
 - Add a retreat option in levels if player is losing.
 - Varying weapon damage types and defences that can add stratagy to fighting certain enemies
 - Add Armour and defence stats
 - More enemies, levels and weapons
